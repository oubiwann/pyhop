# PyHOP, version 2.0

A Hierarchical Ordered Planner for Python

## Introduction

PyHOP is a simple hierarchical task network (HTN) planner written in Python. It works in both Python 2.7 and 3.2.

PyHOP was easy to implement (less than 150 lines of code), and if you understand the basic ideas of HTN planning ([this presentation](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nau/papers/nau2013game.pdf) contains a quick summary),
PyHOP should be easy to understand.

PyHOP's planning algorithm is like the one in [SHOP](http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/shop/), but with several differences that should make it easier to integrate it with ordinary computer programs:

  - PyHOP represents states of the world using ordinary variable bindings, not logical propositions. A state is just a Python object that contains the variable bindings.  For example, you might write s.loc['v'] = 'd' to say that vehicle v is at location d in state s.

  - To write HTN operators and methods for PyHOP, you don't need to learn a specialized planning language. Instead, you write them as ordinary Python functions. The current state (e.g., s in the above example) is passed to them as an argument.

## Installation

Ideally PyHOP will be installed in a virtual (e.g., conda) environment. 
For example,

+ `conda create --name=pyhop python=3.9`
+ `conda activate pyhop`

Now, using the virtual environment, we can install the library:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/oubiwann/pyhop.git
$ cd pyhop
$ /opt/anaconda3/envs/pyhop/bin/python -m pip install .
```

## Examples

The code comes with several examples. These can be run in the following manner:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/oubiwann/pyhop.git
$ cd pyhop
$ python examples/simple_travel.py
$ python examples/blocks_world/run1.py
$ python examples/blocks_world/run2.py
```

NOTE: right now there are no unit tests; successful functioning of these examples are rudimentary integration tests. More tests 
will be written in the future.

## Changes from Version 1

With versison 2.0, the following change were made:
* code has now been converted to a Python package, complete with ``setup.py`` file
* slight changes to the API have been made (the planner function ``pyhop`` has been ranamed to ``plan``)
* slight changes to some of the helper functions have been made (added another parameter to help generalize)
* examples have been moved into their own directory
